Fast Robust Predicates for Computational Geometry in modern C++

## Project status: WIP

This project is currently work in progress. I will remove this note, once the project stabilizes.

## What is this all about?

This project ports [Adaptive Precision Floating-Point Arithmetic and Fast Robust Predicates for Computational Geometry](https://www.cs.cmu.edu/~quake/robust.html) by [Jonathan Richard Shewchuk](http://www.cs.berkeley.edu/~jrs) to modern C++.

## Acknowledgement

This project is just a port. All the hard work was done by [Jonathan Richard Shewchuk](http://www.cs.berkeley.edu/~jrs).

## License

This port follows the decision of the [original code](https://www.cs.cmu.edu/afs/cs/project/quake/public/code/predicates.c), which was released into the public domain without any restrictions. Use it for whatever you see fit, see [The Unlicense](https://unlicense.org/).
